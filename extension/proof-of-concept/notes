1) can we set up a separate script for the main.js and the sub.js? 
  -> sub is loaded from the iframe
  -> main is loaded from our webserver
  DONE-- BUT: change the localhost to be for our actual webapp
2) We should be able to, from the main.js, tell our sub.js to post a message
  DONE (proof of concept)
  NOTE: this will require our main.js to be watching our client / listening for some sort of message send event
3) We should be able to, from the sub.js, tell our main.js we have received a new message, and pass that message along [NOTE: this requires PARSING]
4) MAKE SURE WE DONT READ ALL YOUR MESSAGES UNLESS YOU GO TO OUR APP
